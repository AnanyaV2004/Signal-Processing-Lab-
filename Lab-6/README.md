# Lab6

- different codes are wriiten for each subpart of different questions
- all the codes are self explanatory.
- the audio files required for part 6.7 are saved as "file_example_WAV_1MG", "file_example_WAV_2MG", "file_example_WAV_5MG", "file_example_WAV_10MG" in the Code Folder.
- The sampling frequency, bit rate, duration and number of bits stored by the ADC for the 4 audio signals of part 6.7 are present as png images named "q7_1", "q7_2", "q7_3", "q7_4" in the Result folder.
- The code for calculating the above mentioned quantities and using sound() function in 6.7 is present as "q7_1.m", q7_2.m", "q7_3.m", "q7_4.m" for the 4 given audio files in the code folder. 
- The code for listening to sound at higher and lesser frequencies in 6.7 is present as "q7_highfs.m" and "q7_lowfs.m" in the code forlder.
- code for 6.1 a part is present as "continuousFT.m"
- Haven't attempted the optionals in any of the questions.
- In 6.3, the radix2fft function is written in "radix2fft.m" and verification of this function using cos(t) as input is done in "q3.m".
- The verification plot of 6.3 is present as "q3_verification.png" in Result folder.
- Code for 6.4 part (a) is present as "myLPF.m"
- Code for 6.4 part b and c is given as "q4_bc.m"
- Code for 6.5 a,b and plotting sinc interpolation script and calculation MAE is given as "q5.m" and plots for all three interpolations is given as "q5_interpolation.png" and the image of the MAE observed is given as "q5_MAE.png"
- The codes for all the required functions are saved as "<<name_of_function>>.m" in the Code folder.
